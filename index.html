                <p>In our project, I address Horizon State University's growing challenge of declining retention during the first two years of undergraduate study. I identified that advisors currently lack a unified and proactive way to monitor academic, financial, and engagement risk factors, because this information is spread across disconnected systems. This fragmentation leads to delays, missed warnings, and inconsistent interventions, ultimately increasing the chances of academic failure or withdrawal. To solve this problem, I developed the Student Risk Monitoring Dashboard, a centralized platform built using artificially generated student data. My system brings together academic records, attendance, financial aid indicators, and engagement behaviors into one dashboard. By applying predictive analytics, the platform identifies early signs of students at risk of program dropout and provides advisors with real-time alerts and personalized recommendations that they can send to students. This allows advisors to intervene earlier and focus their attention on the students who need support the most.</p>

                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>HSU is experiencing declining student retention during the first two years of undergraduate study. HSU currently tracks academic performance, attendance, financial aid, and student engagement through multiple disconnected systems. Advisors rely on fragmented data and anecdotal evidence, which prevents timely identification of at-risk students. This lack of centralized, actionable insights hinders proactive interventions and limits the university's ability to support students effectively.</p>

                        <li><strong>Students:</strong> Face academic, financial, and engagement challenges without early intervention</li>
                        <li><strong>Academic Advisors:</strong> Contend with fragmented data, manual tracking, and limited time</li>
                        <li><strong>University Administration:</strong> Declining retention affects financial outcomes and institutional reputation</li>

                    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
                    <p>Fragmented information systems, absence of predictive analytics, and manual intervention processes prevent advisors from acting early or prioritizing support. Students who might benefit from timely guidance often disengage or leave their programs, which negatively impacts individual outcomes and reduces institutional retention and performance metrics.</p>

                <p>The Student Risk Monitoring Dashboard was designed to meet the needs of Horizon State University advisors by combining early risk detection, unified student insights, and actionable intervention tools in a streamlined interface. The dashboard follows a top-down flow: advisors begin with an overview of institutional-level indicators, move into individualized at-risk student lists, and explore deeper analytic insights through visualizations.

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dataset Design:</strong> Balanced realism with model robustness by ensuring variables like GPA, attendance, and engagement mirrored real student behaviors while providing meaningful variance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Visualization Strategy:</strong> Iteratively revised charts, color coding, and layouts based on usability feedback to help advisors quickly identify at-risk students without cognitive overload.</li>
                            <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Prioritized academic, engagement, and financial indicators over demographic attributes to reduce bias and ensure fair predictions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Batch Processing:</strong> Separated model training from dashboard usage to ensure efficiency and keep advisor focus on interventions rather than technical processes.</li>

                        <p>This project pushed my team to think critically about the intersection of data, technology, and student success. I entered with a straightforward goal—build a risk monitoring dashboard—but quickly realized the complexity of creating a truly useful tool that balances predictive power with ethical responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Each team member brought unique strengths: some excelled at data engineering, others at machine learning, and some at visualization design and user experience. I learned to leverage these differences and work collaboratively. My most productive moments came when I embraced diverse perspectives and challenged assumptions about what "at-risk" means and how to intervene effectively.</p>
                        <p>The most valuable lesson was understanding that technology alone doesn't solve problems—it enables solutions when combined with deep user understanding, ethical considerations, and iterative refinement. I'm proud not just of what I built, but of how I built it: collaboratively, thoughtfully, and with student success at the center.</p>

                <h2>Project Impact & Outcomes</h2>
                <p class="conclusion-text">The Student Risk Monitoring Dashboard delivers a fully functional application that demonstrates how predictive analytics and centralized insights can support student success at Horizon State University. By consolidating fragmented data—including GPA, attendance, course completion, engagement metrics, work hours, and financial aid—into a single dashboard, advisors can identify at-risk students efficiently and take targeted interventions.</p>
                <p class="conclusion-text">In the long term, the platform has the potential to increase retention, improve academic performance, and reduce program dropout rates, mitigating financial and reputational losses for the university. This project validated the power of research-backed design, ethical data practices, and collaborative development. Most importantly, it showed that when institutions have access to proactive, data-driven insights, they can create an equitable advising culture that supports every student's path to success.</p>
