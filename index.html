            <div class="summary-content">
                <p>In our project, we address Horizon State University's growing challenge of declining retention during the first two years of undergraduate study. We identified that advisors currently lack a unified and proactive way to monitor academic, financial, and engagement risk factors, because this information is spread across disconnected systems. This fragmentation leads to delays, missed warnings, and inconsistent interventions, ultimately increasing the chances of academic failure or withdrawal. To solve this problem, we developed the Student Risk Monitoring Dashboard, a centralized platform built using artificially generated student data. Our system brings together academic records, attendance, financial aid indicators, and engagement behaviors into one dashboard. By applying predictive analytics, the platform identifies early signs of students at risk of program dropout and provides advisors with real-time alerts and personalized recommendations that they can send to students. This allows advisors to intervene earlier and focus their attention on the students who need support the most.</p>

                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>HSU is experiencing declining student retention during the first two years of undergraduate study. HSU currently tracks academic performance, attendance, financial aid, and student engagement through multiple disconnected systems. Advisors rely on fragmented data and anecdotal evidence, which prevents timely identification of at-risk students. This lack of centralized, actionable insights hinders proactive interventions and limits the university's ability to support students effectively.</p>

                    <ul class="stakeholder-list">
                        <li><strong>Students:</strong> Face academic, financial, and engagement challenges without early intervention</li>
                        <li><strong>Academic Advisors:</strong> Contend with fragmented data, manual tracking, and limited time</li>
                        <li><strong>University Administration:</strong> Declining retention affects financial outcomes and institutional reputation</li>

                    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
                    <p>Fragmented information systems, absence of predictive analytics, and manual intervention processes prevent advisors from acting early or prioritizing support. Students who might benefit from timely guidance often disengage or leave their programs, which negatively impacts individual outcomes and reduces institutional retention and performance metrics.</p>

                        <h5>Database Schema & Entity Relationships</h5>
                        <p>The comprehensive relational database model consists of eight interconnected entities, each serving a specific function in the student risk monitoring ecosystem:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Students (Central Entity):</strong> Core table containing student_id (primary key), age, gender, ethnicity, first_generation_flag, major, residence, enrollment_status, and financial_aid_flag. Acts as the hub connecting all other entities through foreign key relationships.</li>
                            <li><strong>Academic_Records:</strong> Stores term-by-term academic performance including record_id, student_id (foreign key), term, credits_attempted, course_drop_count, late_registration, gpa_term, cum_gpa, and probation_flag. One-to-many relationship from students (one student has multiple academic records across terms).</li>
                            <li><strong>Engagement_Metrics:</strong> Tracks student participation with engagement_id, student_id (foreign key), term, lms_logins, attendance_rate, assignments_on_time_pct, discussion_posts, and library_visits. Captures behavioral indicators that predict retention risk.</li>
                            <li><strong>Support_Services:</strong> Records utilization of support resources via service_id, student_id (foreign key), term, advisor_meetings, and tutoring_sessions. Helps identify students not accessing available help.</li>
                            <li><strong>Financial_Records:</strong> Manages financial data through financial_id, student_id (foreign key), term, outstanding_balance, and work_hours_per_week. Links financial stress to academic risk.</li>
                            <li><strong>Risk_Assessments:</strong> Contains predictive model outputs including assessment_id, student_id (foreign key), term, dropout_probability, and at_risk_flag. Stores ML-generated risk scores for advisor action.</li>
                            <li><strong>Professors:</strong> Maintains faculty information with professor_id (primary key), username, email, and password_hash for secure authentication and intervention tracking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interventions:</strong> Logs advisor actions through intervention_id, student_id (foreign key), professor_id (foreign key), intervention_type, intervention_date, and notes. Creates accountability trail for intervention effectiveness analysis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Key Relationships:</strong> The students table serves as the central hub with one-to-many relationships to academic_records, engagement_metrics, support_services, financial_records, risk_assessments, and interventions. The interventions table has a many-to-one relationship with professors, enabling tracking of which advisors perform which interventions. This normalized structure prevents data redundancy while enabling comprehensive student profiles assembled through JOIN operations across all dimensions.</p>

                                Histogram displaying the distribution of student attendance rates across the institution, with a critical 80% threshold marked by the red dashed line. The visualization reveals a right-skewed distribution with the majority of students maintaining strong attendance: approximately 4,000 students achieve 90-95% attendance (the highest peak), while 3,000 students maintain 85-90% attendance. However, the left side of the threshold shows concerning patterns with approximately 2,700 students in the 75-80% range, 1,300 students at 70-75%, 500 students at 65-70%, and small groups below 65% attendance. Combined, roughly 3,077 students fall below the 80% threshold, representing the at-risk population requiring immediate advisor outreach and intervention to prevent further disengagement and potential dropout.</p>

                            <p>This histogram displays the distribution of cumulative GPA (Grade Point Average) across a population, with a red dashed line marking a 2.0 threshold. The x-axis represents GPA values ranging from 1.5 to 4.0, while the y-axis shows the count or frequency of students at each GPA level. The distribution is roughly bell-shaped but slightly left-skewed, with the highest concentration of students having GPAs between 2.5 and 3.0, where the count peaks at approximately 3,500 students. The 2.0 threshold likely represents a minimum academic standing requirement, such as the cutoff for good academic standing or eligibility for certain programs. Notably, the majority of students fall above this threshold, with relatively few students (fewer than 500) having GPAs below 2.0. The distribution tapers off at both extremes, with fewer students at the lowest (below 2.0) and highest (above 3.5) GPA ranges, suggesting most students maintain moderate to good academic performance</p>

                            <p>Students by Gender (left chart in purple tones): The student body is nearly evenly distributed across three categories, with male students at 33.5%, female students at 33.5%, and students identifying as "Other" at 33%. This shows a remarkably balanced gender distribution with strong representation across all categories.
                                Enrollment Status (middle chart in blue tones): The vast majority of students are enrolled full-time at 85.4%, while part-time students make up only 14.6%. This indicates a predominantly full-time student population, which is typical for traditional undergraduate institutions.
                                First Generation Status (right chart in green tones): Non-first-generation students comprise 70% of the population, while first-generation college students represent 30%. This shows that while most students have family members who attended college before them, there is still a substantial proportion of students who are the first in their families to pursue higher education, highlighting the importance of support services for this demographic.

The left panel, "Student Distribution by Ethnicity," displays remarkably balanced representation with approximately 3,650 White students (red bar), 3,600 Asian students (mint green), 3,600 Hispanic students (turquoise), 3,550 Black students (blue), and 3,550 Other category students (purple). The color gradient from 3,550 to 3,650 shows minimal variation, confirming equitable ethnic representation. The right panel, "Age Group Risk Analysis," reveals at-risk percentages across five age cohorts: Under 20 shows 9.8% at-risk (lightest peach), the 20-25 cohort displays 10.2% at-risk (darkest burgundy, representing the highest risk group), 26-30 shows 9.7% at-risk (light peach), 31-35 shows moderate risk (medium peach), and 35+ shows 10.2% at-risk (medium-dark peach). The 20-25 age group annotation ("Age Group=26-30, At-Risk %=9.7") highlights this as the largest student cohort. The remarkably consistent at-risk percentages (9.7-10.2% across all ages) demonstrate that our predictive model evaluates students based on behavior and performance rather than demographic characteristics, ensuring ethical, unbiased risk assessment across all ethnic and age groups.</p>

                            <p>This histogram displays the distribution of predicted dropout probabilities for students, revealing a stark bimodal pattern. The x-axis represents the predicted dropout probability ranging from 0 (no risk) to 1 (high risk), while the y-axis shows the count of students in each probability range.
                                The distribution shows two distinct peaks at opposite ends of the spectrum. The overwhelming majority of students, approximately 15,000, cluster at the far left near 0, indicating they have a very low predicted probability of dropping out. Conversely, a much smaller group of around 2,000 students appears at the far right near a probability of 1, suggesting they are at extremely high risk of dropping out. The middle range (probabilities between 0.2 and 0.8) is nearly empty, with minimal student counts.</p>

                            <p>Comprehensive correlation matrix (15×15) displaying relationships between academic, engagement, behavioral, and risk prediction variables using a red-to-blue color scheme (correlation values from +1 to -1). The diagonal dark red line represents perfect self-correlation (1.0). Critical findings reveal strong positive correlations among academic metrics: gpa_term and cum_gpa show deep red correlation (~0.8-0.9), indicating consistent performance across terms. Engagement behaviors cluster together with moderate positive correlations: attendance_rate, assignments_on_time_pct, and lms_logins show light red/orange relationships (~0.3-0.5), confirming that engaged students participate across multiple dimensions. The bottom two rows (pred_dropout_probability and pred_at_risk_flag) are particularly revealing: they display strong negative correlations (dark blue, ~-0.4 to -0.6) with academic performance metrics (cum_gpa, gpa_term, attendance_rate) but show positive correlations (blue/purple, ~0.2-0.4) with risk indicators like course_drop_count. Notably, demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity) show minimal correlation with dropout probability (light blue/white, near 0), validating our ethical modeling approach. Work_hours_per_week displays a notable negative correlation (dark blue) with advisor_meetings and tutoring_sessions, suggesting working students have less time for support services. This heatmap confirms that academic performance and engagement behaviors are the strongest predictors of student success, justifying our feature selection strategy and demonstrating that the model prioritizes actionable behavioral indicators over immutable demographic characteristics.</p>

                        <p>Each team member brought unique strengths: some excelled at data engineering, others at machine learning, and some at visualization design and user experience. We learned to leverage these differences and work collaboratively. Our most productive moments came when we embraced diverse perspectives and challenged assumptions about what "at-risk" means and how to intervene effectively.</p>
                        <p>The most valuable lesson was understanding that technology alone doesn't solve problems, it enables solutions when combined with deep user understanding, ethical considerations, and iterative refinement. We're proud not just of what we built, but of how we built it: collaboratively, thoughtfully, and with student success at the center.</p>

                <h2>Project Impact & Outcomes</h2>
                <p class="conclusion-text">The Student Risk Monitoring Dashboard delivers a fully functional application that demonstrates how predictive analytics and centralized insights can support student success at Horizon State University. By consolidating fragmented data, including GPA, attendance, course completion, engagement metrics, work hours, and financial aid into a single dashboard, advisors can identify at-risk students efficiently and take targeted interventions.</p>
                <p class="conclusion-text">In the long term, the platform has the potential to increase retention, improve academic performance, and reduce program dropout rates, mitigating financial and reputational losses for the university. This project validated the power of research-backed design, ethical data practices, and collaborative development. Most importantly, it showed that when institutions have access to proactive, data-driven insights, they can create an equitable advising culture that supports every student's path to success.</p>
